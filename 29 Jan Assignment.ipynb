The identifier should start with a character or Underscore then use a digit. The characters are A-Z or a-z, an Underscore ( _ ) , and digit (0-9). we should not use special characters ( #, @, $, %, ! ) in identifiers."

    "### Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "In various books of python programming, it is mentioned that python language is interpreted. But that is half correct the python program is first compiled and then interpreted. The compilation part is hidden from the programmer thus, many programmers believe that it is an interpreted language. The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code and internally this byte code gets converted by the python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to the underlying platform(machine+operating system).\n",
    "Now the question is – if there is any proof that python first compiles the program internally and then run the code via interpreter?\n",
    "The answer is yes! and note this compiled part is get deleted by the python(as soon as you execute your code) just it does not want programmers to get into complexity."
