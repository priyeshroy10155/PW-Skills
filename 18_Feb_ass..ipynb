    "An API Gateways Provides flexibility to use completely independent protocols allowing your microservices to communicate among themselves with ease. They allow developers to access the functionality of a subset of architecture in many different ways, without ever exposing the endpoints publicly. It doesn’t matter if you are using microservices or serverless architecture or a public API, API Gateways have a lot of benefits to offer.\n",

    "There are lots of reasons for use and API Gateway but there are certain drawbacks that you should consider.\n",
    "There’s a learning curve when it comes to architecting applications high availability applications at scale especially since the API gateway is going to be the single point on of entry between the front end and the APIs it will also act as a single point of failure."

    "## Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol is a network platform used in a web service to exchange or communicate data between two different machines on a network. It uses the XML format of data to transfer messages over the HTTP protocol. In Web services, SOAP allows the user request to interact with other programming languages. In this way, it provides a way to communicate between applications running on different platforms (Operating system), with programming languages and technologies used in web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style that provides standards between computer systems on a web service. It is a set of constraints used to create a lightweight, scalable, and maintainable web service that facilitates easy communication. It is a set of constraints used to create a lightweight, scalable and maintainable web service that makes easy communication with each other. All web services are based on the REST; hence it is called a RESTful service. The purpose of developing a RESTful web service is to make the web service more effective. The Roy Fielding develops it in 2000, who also developed the HTTP protocol. It does not depend on a specific protocol to use, but it's used HTTP/HTTPS."
